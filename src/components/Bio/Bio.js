                I'm a software engineer specializing in building responsive websites, and applications.
                I am passionate about implementing ideas into reality. As a developer I enjoy taking on challenges, 
                solving problems, using my obsessive attention to detail, and my mission-driven 
                work ethic to have an impact on everyone around me whether it's from customers or small businesses 
                to large companies.
